## The opensource initiative by Sophtron

This project aims sharing the implementation of the banking widget provided by Sophtron to our open banking partners 
Our goal is to provide a fully functional out of box experience with the flexibility of in-depth customization 

please navigate to [ui/README](ui/README.md) to get start with the widget ui source code.

## Demo

A Sophtron hosted instance can be accessed at [Mock Mode](https://widget.sophtron.com/mock) or [Demo Mode](https://widget.sophtron.com/demo) 
- We recommend using Mock Mode to view the widget UI and using Demo Mode to try sophtron banking features
- For a basic tryout about sophtron widget, we recommend choosing the mocked types of "Sophtron Bank" to get started with the work flow without a needing a real bank credentials. 
- You are free to use real bank credentials, your data is well protected,  however we recommend using a dedicated test bank account for demo, or register and integrate your own widget integration with your account API keys
- Detailed instruction coming soon.
